Thanks for downloading the FLVR\'99.  In just a minute, it'll be chilling on Safari's Toolbar.\

You'll be able to capture video from such popular sites as YouTube, Google Video, MetaCafe...  and, well from just about any video site you can think of.  FLVR\'99 converts the video to iPod-friendly MPEG-4, so you can take your videos with you wherever you go.  Best of all, it's one-click simple.}
