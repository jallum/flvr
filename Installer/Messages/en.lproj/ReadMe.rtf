This is 
\b BETA
\b0  software.  It is 
\i not finished
\i0 , and is certainly not free of bugs.  That being said, we think that you'll enjoy using this preview of the FLVR.  If you do experience problems, or have ideas as to how FLVR might be improved before it's final release, we'd certainly like to hear about them.\
\
Also, you might want to take advantage of our discount for people that 
\b pre-order
\b0  before the beta period is over.  This is a limited time offer.  Customers that pre-order now will pay $8 (instead of the normal $15) -- a savings of almost 50% -- and will receive instructions for downloading the final version before it will be available to the general public.\
